# What is CoopR?
The abbreviation CoopR resolves into Coop Roleplay. These two keywords are leading the whole idea of this modification. CoopR Mod is a gameplay overhaul. Combining coop gameplay with interesting yet not immersion-killing roleplay game elements.

# Alpha Features
The primary goal is to extend the gameplay of coop multiplayer squads. It is a small subset of the whole CoopR mod idea. When the development of CoopR Mod started it was clear that this modification will take at least two years to implement all planned features. As time went by the amount of feature ideas grew and therefore the release date was pushed back further into the unknown future.
To this date the CoopR team managed to develop a working base with a good amount of core features. We realized that there is a basic feature set ready to be released. We expect to receive hands-on feedback and suggestions that help adjusting the development process. Reported bugs will be brought into the development of CoopR and fixed in future releases.
The following conditions need to be met so an addon is a candidate to be released in the CoopR Light release:
